This project uses Plotly to plot the fractals generated by the Chaos Game. Specifically, the goal is to generate what is known as Sierpinski (or Pascal) triangle, by starting with 3 vertices (V1, V2, V3), and a (pseudo-)random starting point within the boundaries of the triangle made with said vertices. In each iteration, a vertex is chosen (pseudo-)randomly. A new point (n) is then created and directed to the chosen vertex and placed at half the distance between the chosen vertex and the last added point (n-1). After a few hundred iterations, the silhouette of the Sierpinsky triangle starts to appear.
